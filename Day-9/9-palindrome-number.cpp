1) Negative Number Check:

The function first checks if 洧논 is negative or if 洧논 ends with a zero (but is not zero itself). If either condition is true, the number is not a palindrome.
2) Reversing Half the Number:

The function then reverses the second half of the number and compares it to the first half. This is done by initializing a reversed variable to 0 and then iteratively appending the last digit of 洧논 to reversed while removing the last digit from 洧논.
3) Comparison:

Finally, the function checks if the first half of 洧논 is equal to reversed or if the first half of 洧논 is equal to reversed / 10. The second comparison accounts for the case where the number has an odd number of digits.
